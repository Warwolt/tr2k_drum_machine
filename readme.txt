This is my sideproject drum machine, meant to be some kind of 808/909 style
analog affair powered by an atmega328 microcontroller for the step sequencer.

The step sequencer software is written in C++, because C++ is a great language
and embedded software can absolutely benefit from some higher abstractions.

Some goals of this little sideproject for starters:

	o 	Drum machine should sound authentic (ish) to the original Roland machines.
	o 	It should support a very similar (hardware) user interface to the 808 and the 909.
	o 	Software should be object-oriented and aware of the hardware it runs on.
	o 	Written in idiomatic C++11 code ("Modern C++").
	o 	Be a fun!
