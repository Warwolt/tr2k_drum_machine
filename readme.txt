This is my sideproject drum machine, meant to be some kind of 808/909 style
analog affair powered by an atmega328 microcontroller for the step sequencer.

The step sequencer software is written in C++, because C++ is a great language
and embedded software can absolutely benefit from some higher abstractions.

Some goals of this little sideproject for starters:

	o 	Sound authentic (ish) to the original Roland machines
	o 	Support a very similair (hardware) user interface to the 808 and the 909
	o 	Have object-oriented code that is also aware of the hardware it runs on (the assembly)
	o 	Be a fun project!
